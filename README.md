## Credit and Collaborations

### Logistical

- Nicholas and I agreed to be open to communication during all class times and up to 8 PM (specific to our time zone)
- We will communicate with slack and discord primarily.
- We agreed to take breaks as needed, and to at least take a break every 2 hours regardless.
- Communicate with our instructor and seek help from TAs if we feel we are falling behind the project timeline.

### Cooperative

- Nicholas and I have similar strength level in the JavaScript back-end portion of the lab assignment, however Nicholas is stronger in the front-end area.  We both have good communication and time management skills that will be helpful in staying on track.  Both being prior military we are comfortable with delegation and trusting each other to get the work done or ask for help if needed.
- We can utilize our strengths well by leaning on each other when needed.  We understand that we will both get confused at portions, but working together will improve our likelihood of success.  
- Nicholas wants to get more comfortable in the technical jargon side of back end development and I want to improve on my styling skills to allow for a more efficient front end.
- We will work on sections together utilizing the driver/navigator method of coding to ensure we both understand what each part of the code is doing.

### Conflict Resolution

- We will ensure everyone is pulling their own weight by assigning tasks and allowing us to complete them on our own or in a driver/navigator programming style.
- We will keep an open line of communication and voice any concerns we have with each other in a respectful conversation.
- Understand that everyone has different commitments outside of the classroom and set realistic expectations for each other on a daily basis.  We both know that we are not "professional programmers" yet, so we will encounter a large number of walls throughout this project. Understanding that we are both students and are in a learning environment will help us keep a professional and understanding approach to each problem we face.
